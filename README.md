## Joe Cowton.

In 2011 I completed an MSc in Music Production which comprised predominantly of writing DSP plug-ins. Since then I’ve earned a living as an electronic musician: touring the world several times and working with some of the most respected names and record labels in underground music. I am now looking to sidestep into the world of software and web development, combining what I've learnt on the road with the coding knowledge i hope to acquire while studying at MA.
