## Joe Cowton

I am a focused and ambitous Junior Full Stack Developer, seeking a role in which I can expand and develop my programming knowledge while finding an area of expertise.

Since 2008 I’ve earned a living as an electronic musician: touring the world several times and working with some of the most respected names in underground music. I've broadcast live on Radio 1 from Glastonbury and featured on the cover of The Wire magazine.
