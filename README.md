I am a focused and ambitious Junior Full Stack Developer, seeking a role in which I can expand and develop my programming knowledge while finding an area of expertise.

I've recently completed an intensive four month software development course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). During this time I've worked hard on best practices and TDD approaches to development, and vastly expanded my understanding of contemporary software frameworks and databases. I've been paired each day with people of all abilities and taken great satisfaction from the Academy's culture of accelerated learning and focus on writing clear and concise code. I'm constantly learning new skills and I'm incredibly excited to see where life as a developer can take me.

I have an MSc in Music Technology, the thesis for which I developed a machine learning algorithm to extract rhythmic elements from acoustic music using FFT analysis. Since 2008 I’ve earned a living as an electronic musician: touring the world several times over and working with some of the most respected names in underground music. I've broadcast live on [Radio 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03f5w84) a number of times and featured on the cover of [The Wire](https://www.thewire.co.uk/shop/back-issues/issue_355-26647) magazine.

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
|[Bank](https://github.com/joecowton/bank)| A bank tech-test written in JS with extensive testing in Jasmine. Though a relatively simple task I was particularly proud of how clean and to the point the code was, this felt like something of a breakthrough. | JavaScript, Jasmine |
|[Weather App](https://github.com/joecowton/react-redux-weather) | An app to display a five day forecast for a specific location. Fetchs data from a remote API using a Redux action creator and renders via React.| React, Redux, Mocha, Chai |
|[FooDeals](https://github.com/joecowton/foodie)| A group project intended to help with food wastage by retailers. My role was get work with Node-Express and MongoDB to create an online database for products. We eventually connected our frontend to Tesco's API and simulated a potential real world implementation. | React, Node.js, Google OAuth, MongoDB, Mocha |

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 - January 2018)

A intensive four month course which focused on:
- Object oriented programming in [Ruby](https://github.com/joecowton/rps-challenge) and [Javascript](https://github.com/joecowton/bank).
- Test driven development using [Jasmine](https://github.com/joecowton/gilded-rose), [Capybara](https://github.com/joecowton/makersbnb) and RSpec.
- Pair programming and working in groups, learning to project share on Github.
- Using [Node-Express](https://github.com/joecowton/foodie) and [Rails](https://github.com/joecowton/instagram-challenge) to create back-end servers.
- Front end development using React and [Redux](https://github.com/joecowton/react-redux-weather) to store data in state.
- Working with databases using both [Sequelize](https://github.com/joecowton/database-express) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/joecowton/database-express), and Mongoose and MongoDB.
- Hosting databases remotely using mLAb and ElephantSQL.

#### University of West England (2008 - 2011) MSc Music Technology (Distinction)

- A three year masters course with an emphasis on developing music software in C++ using the [Juce](https://juce.com/) framework. Built a number of DSP audio plugins: reverbs, delays, flangers and other time based processors.
- Developed a machine learning application to extract rhythms and instrument types from audio recordings using a complex process involving [FFT analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) and neural networks to successfully parse the audio. The app then replaced the sounds from the original recording with sounds of the users choice.

#### School of Sound Recording, Manchester (2004-2006) HND Music Production and Development (Distinction)

- Audio production: Pro-Tools, Logic, Cubase, live recording.

## Skills

#### Collaboration
- Both in [music](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2102) and [coding](https://github.com/joecowton/makers-bnb) I actively enjoy working with others. I am sensitive to those around me and take pride in my ability to communicate effectively and dissipate conflicts when they arise.

#### Motivation
- As someone who has been self-employed for the past ten years I have learnt to manage my time each day to maximise my productivity. In this time I've released [30+ records](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1606986-Kowton) while touring constantly and also completing a masters.

#### Commitment
- Having decided to embark on a life as a developer I invested £8k from my own pocket in attending the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) bootcamp. I completed the course while maintaining a reduced touring schedule, only missing one day of attendance due to flight cancellations.

#### Vision
- I have helped to grow the record label I co-founded [(Livity Sound)](https://livitysound.bandcamp.com/) from an embryonic idea to an [internationally recognised record](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1970) label with a global fanbase. We achieved this by making bold stylistic choices and ensuring our product was always as strong as possible, both in terms of music and presentation.

#### Perseverance
- [Live performance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07gndrb) has taught me a huge amount about resilience to everything from pressure and expectation to failure and criticism. Being able to stay objective in the face of negative situations is a strength I have had to learn, but it is something I feel is equally applicable in development as it is music.
